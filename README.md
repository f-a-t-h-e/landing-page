## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.


My word:
	-Most of my editing on comments that I made is between brackets ().
	-The page can detrmine which section must be selected as active by a group of functions based on scrolling and viewport.
	-Each link can be set as active when its section is active and when the mouse pointer hovers on it.
	-The navigation bar is filled with the number of the sections as anchors to each section throw connection by 'data-nav' and 'data-nav-nav' attributes.
	-I gave the links the attribute 'data-nav-nav' becuase I wanted to avoid selecting the sections with the links when I want to select the links only.
	-I added the 'menu__show' box to make the navigation bar easier to get hiden for mobile phone users.
	-I added a button for scrolling to the top of the page easily.
